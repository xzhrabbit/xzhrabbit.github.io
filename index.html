			<h3><u>Projects</u> <a href="https://xzhrabbit.github.io/ds/"><b>[Link to Details]</b></a>]</h3>
			<ul>
			<p>
			<b>Battle of the Midsize University Towns in US</b><br>
			• Applied unsupervised machine learning to cluster midsize university towns in US. <br>
			• Conducted web scraping and data wrangling to build a structured database of ~300 
				towns with features regarding the town, university and nearby venue distributions. <br>
			• Applied k-means clustering; revealed the strong influence of regional cultures 
				on the university towns although they are generally considered to be highly diversified. <br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Fruit Classification</b><br>
			• Performed image classifications on 111 types of fruits and vegetables. <br>
			• Built models (e.g. Random Forests and ConvNet) and trained on > 50,000 images of fruits and vegetables; 
				achieved an accuracy of 99.2% on unseen test set using ConvNet with ~380k parameters. <br>
			• Explored transfer learning using pre-trained VGG19 (~80k trainable parameters) and achieved an accuracy of 93.0%. <br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Sentiment Analysis: Amazon Reviews</b><br>
			• Applied machine learning methods to analyze the polarity (i.e. positive or negative) of Amazon reviews. <br>
			• Processed ~ 4 million reviews from Amazon and built models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, 
				1D ConvNet and RNN-LSTM) to classify the tokenized texts. <br>
			• Achieved the best accuracy of 94.5% using 1D ConvNet. <br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Taxi Fare Prediction in New York City</b><br>
			• Trained regression models to predict the taxi fare amount in NYC given pickup time and pickup/drop off locations. <br>
			• Conducted feature engineering, cross validation, and hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn; 
				applied lightGBM and neural network models on a training set of > 20M examples. <br>
			• Achieved the lowest RMSE of 2.88 USD using lightGBM. <br>
			</p>
			
			</ul>
			<h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
			<ul>
			<p>
			<style="text-align:left;"><b>Ames Laboratory, DOE</b>
				<span style="float:right;">Ames, IA</span><br>
			<style="text-align:left;"><i>Postdoctoral Research Associate</i>
				<span style="float:right;">05/2015 – 03/2019</span><br>
			• Discovered and designed new compounds in computer; guided experimental synthesis of stable, desired materials. <br>
			• Developed methods and codes to screen and classify thousands of candidate crystal structures. <br>
			• Conducted data analysis and visualization on experimental output; 
				developed theories to side with experiments for compelling stories, which led to multiple high impact publications and news coverages. <br>
			</p>
			<p>
			<style="text-align:left;"><b>Iowa State University</b>
				<span style="float:right;">Ames, IA</span><br>
			<style="text-align:left;"><i>Research Assistant</i>
				<span style="float:right;">05/2010 – 05/2015</span><br>
			• Developed adaptive Genetic Algorithm code for geometry optimization of atoms in materials using C/C++ and MPI. <br>
			• Deployed the code for production run on 100,000+ CPU supercomputers and demonstrated good scalability and efficiency; 
				applied it in solving crystal structures of numerous energy-related materials, such as solar cell materials, permanent magnets and Li-ion battery materials. <br>
			• Trained linear regression cluster expansion model for multi-component alloy systems, achieving 1E-3 eV accuracy in energy 
				and millions of times speedup compared with quantum mechanics methods. <br>
			• Trained empirical force fields using simulated annealing for crystal structure predictions and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. <br>
			• Developed Monte Carlo simulation code for alloys, leading to the discovery of a new phase in alnico magnets. <br>
			</p>
